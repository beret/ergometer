Ergometer
=========
Ergometer is a partially developed application for OS X that counts keystrokes and mouse clicks over various intervals of time, shows this information in the system status bar, and logs it in a human-readable text format.

Optionally, it can be configured to enforce keystroke and time limits by fading the screen to black until a configurable resting period has elapsed.

If Ergometer is installed on multiple Macs and its configuration/logging directory is synced by a service like Dropbox or Google Drive, the application will share a single configuration and will merge the logs so that any activity limits are enforced based on the sum total of activity.
