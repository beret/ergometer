# Ergometer
Ergometer is a [Chrome extension][1] intended to prevent or mitigate RSI by monitoring user activity.

With it, you can:
- Configure targets (enforced by increasingly insistent reminders) for total daily activity, individual activity sessions, and rest breaks between sessions.
- Pause or resume monitoring at any time.
- Display historical activity.
