# Ergometer

Ergometer is a Windows program intended to prevent or mitigate RSI by monitoring user activity.

With it, you can:

- Configure targets (enforced by increasingly insistent reminders) for total daily activity, individual activity sessions, and rest breaks between sessions.
- Display historical activity.
- Sync all activity between computers (requires an internet-accessible server to act as a relay).
